    <p id="about">
      This website was created in the 8th of april 2022, to make game browsing
      easier and more accessible to everyone. We're simply two modest web
      developers trying to have fun while also attempting to make it easier for
      those who want to find games they enjoy, rather than just browsing
      aimlessly on the internet. This website has a system that stores games and
      organizes them into categories so that you can discover your favorite
      genre easily. The genres range from puzzle games and brain teasers, to
      high action first person shooters, and even story-driven single player
      games.
